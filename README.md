## Contribution guide

This project uses git flow. It means that when you want to develop a new feature, 
you'll have to create a new branch.

You can't commit directly to `master`, you have to create a feature branch from the
 `develop` branch first.

Then when your feature is complete you can open a pull request for your feature to be
merged to the `develop` branch.

When a version is considered ready, it is merged to the `master` branch and a tag is then
created.

A developper manual is available in the `src/doc` directory.
